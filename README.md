# Finding Plans and Heuristics with Spectral Graph Theory

Some quick and dirty python scripts for generating graphs, computing their spectral heuristics, and drawing the results.

As a starting point have a look at `plot_demos.py`. The driving code is in `spectral_paths.py`. 

This code is associated with work that can be found at [https://schmlz.github.io/spectral-graph-theory/](https://schmlz.github.io/spectral-graph-theory/).
